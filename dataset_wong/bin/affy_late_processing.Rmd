affymetrix - make sure files are in the same order as the target data file, so that you assign the correct ID to the file.


```{r}

## code to get the ensembl_ID mappings

library(biomaRt)
library(dplyr)
library(Biobase)
library(groHMM)

# running these to resolve ssl certificate issues with ensembl
new_config <- httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = FALSE)
httr::set_config(new_config, override = FALSE)

# get the vector of gene codes looking for from existing analysis
## to be updated
rawdata <- read.csv('~/Documents/GitHub/sepsis_ml_omics_msc/XXXX.csv',header = T)
affy_codes <- rawdata$Probe_Id

# select the biomaRt database that you want to connect to - basically always "ensembl". creates object
ensembl <- useMart("ensembl")

# select a dataset within the BioMart database selected with the usemart function. Here selecting human genes out of >200 options.
ensembl <- useDataset("hsapiens_gene_ensembl", mart=ensembl)

# query the selected database - this is the main query call. # not used: values = featureNames(exp.norm).

# NOTE THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED - MAKE A SEPARATE CALL FOR AFFY AND ILLUMINA, SO THAT THE OUTPUTS ARE COMPACT
annotationDF <- getBM(attributes = c('affy_hg_u133_plus_2', 'ensembl_gene_id', 'external_gene_name', 'description', 'gene_biotype'), filters = 'affy_hg_u133_plus_2', values = affy_codes, mart = ensembl)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
